# ResumeAnalyzer
Designed to identify what industry the resume/applicant is strongest in

This was a school project that was submitted and graded for a final grade

Problem Statement & Solution
The problem I choose to solve was analyzing resumes. I wanted to be able to take a large number of resumes, 60-100, at a time and run them through a program. The program would then use several different lexicon lists based off different jobs/industries and would score the resume based off the lists. There would be several different challenges to come based off the problem at hand. To start there are several libraries within python that I would need to use that we did not learn or work with in python. There would also be the challenge of reading a .docx file versus a .txt file. Unfortunately, I was not able to find documentation with python to be able to read and analyze a .docx file, only a .txt file. I would also need to figure out how to connect python to SQL Databases. And finally I will need to be able to read the database into C# to create an application that users can view their scores and resume data.
